# Kargo Quickstart Template

These are the supporting files for [the Kargo Quickstart tutorial](https://docs.akuity.io/tutorials/kargo-quickstart/) in the Akuity docs.

This tutorial will walk you through a working example using Kargo with the Akuity Platform, to manage the promotion of an image from stage to stage in a declarative way.

Ultimately, you will have a Kubernetes cluster, with Applications deployed using an Argo CD control plane; and handle promotion with Kargo.
